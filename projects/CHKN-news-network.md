## THE NEWS ROOM IS A DISASTER!

Or, that's what Cinnamon thinks at least.
Her girlfriend and brother star as the anchors of the popular news channel, CHKN. Typically, their stories are fairly reliable, but lately all of their stories have been scrambled! It's up to the player to save the day and fill in the blanks.

The three characters are made from real chickens at my high school!

## The Task at Hand
Cinnamon prompts the player to enter words fitting her requirements, whether they be nouns or verbs.

When she's asking for food choices, it's best to avoid certain topics...

## A Brilliant News Report
Once the player completes Cinnamon's request, the news is ready to roll!
One of the most entertaining parts of the game is to create the most absurd stories ever based on silly answers given by the player.

Creating this entire project was one of my favorite part of the class I took. Other projects were moreso follow the template, while this was an original creation based on everything I learned over the course of a year.
